### Backbone airplane

Small backbone app for getting the websockets data from the configured server imitating the airplane avionics data.

Most interesting part of the implementation is under public/js/Dashboard.js

Jasmine tests included.

Rake server included.

TODO notes:

--Modules with Require.js: http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/
--It certainly makes sense to move data validations inside the models
